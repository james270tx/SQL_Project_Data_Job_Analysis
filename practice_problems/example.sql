--Aggregation example with GROUP BY

SELECT
    department,
    SUM(salary) AS department_salary
FROM
    employees
GROUP BY
    department;



--Aggregation example with HAVING
--HAVING allows to filter data with an aggregation

SELECT
    department,
    COUNT(employee_id)
FROM
    employees
GROUP BY
    department
HAVING
    COUNT(employee_id) > 10;



--Example with multiple aggrecations

SELECT 
    SUM(salary_year_avg) AS salary_sum,
    COUNT(*) AS count_rows
FROM
    job_postings_fact;



--Example with DISTINCT

SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT job_title_short) AS job_type_total
FROM
    job_postings_fact;



--Example with AVG, MIN, and MAX aggregations

SELECT
    AVG(salary_year_avg) AS salary_avg,
    MIN(salary_year_avg) AS salary_min,
    MAX(salary_year_avg) AS salary_max
FROM

--Example with COUNT, EXTRACT MONTH, WHERE, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY

SELECT

-- Every job_posting on job_postings_fact attempts to JOIN the company_id
